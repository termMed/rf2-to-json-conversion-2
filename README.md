# RF2 to json conversion utility [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/IHTSDO/rf2-to-json-conversion.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/IHTSDO/rf2-to-json-conversion) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/IHTSDO/rf2-to-json-conversion/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/IHTSDO/rf2-to-json-conversion)
Conversion of SNOMED CT RF2 files to a JSON format, including pre-computed indexes for common search strategies

Please see the bottom of this readme file for instructions for users who are developing within the IHTSDO.

## Building (manual instructions)
Build the project using Maven, it will generate an executable jar with embedded dependencies (i.e. "target/rf2-to-json-conversion-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar").

## Conversion configuration
Create a config.xml for the conversion execution, it requires to define the location of the source RF2 Snapshot files.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<config>
    <processInMemory>true</processInMemory>
    <defaultTermLangCode>en</defaultTermLangCode>
    <defaultTermDescriptionType>900000000000003001</defaultTermDescriptionType>
    <defaultTermLanguageRefset>900000000000509007</defaultTermLanguageRefset>
    <normalizeTextIndex>true</normalizeTextIndex>
    <createCompleteConceptsFile>false</createCompleteConceptsFile>
    <editionName>International Edition</editionName>
    <databaseName>en-edition</databaseName>
    <effectiveTime>20140131</effectiveTime>
    <expirationTime>20150201</expirationTime>
    <outputFolder>/Users/alo/Downloads/Releases/en-json</outputFolder>
    <foldersBaselineLoad>
        <folder>/Users/alo/Downloads/Releases/SnomedCT_Release_INT_20140131/RF2Release/Snapshot</folder>
    </foldersBaselineLoad>
    <modulesToIgnoreBaselineLoad>
    </modulesToIgnoreBaselineLoad>
    <foldersExtensionLoad>
    </foldersExtensionLoad>
    <modulesToIgnoreExtensionLoad>
    </modulesToIgnoreExtensionLoad>
</config>
```

Variables:
- _processInMemory_: true for processing with memory maps, really fast, but it requires 8gb of RAM for simple proyects (International Edition + 1 extension). Set to false for using disk based maps, slower but runs with less memory.
- _defaultTermLangCode_: Language code for default term selection.
- _defaultTermDescriptionType_: description type SCTID for the default term selection, some prefer to use the FSN as default term, other prefer to use a Synonym (the preferred synonym will be picked).
- _defaultTermLanguageRefset_: language reference set used to identify the preferred acceptability.
- _normalizeTextIndex_: setting this to True will normalize the text index with diacritics removal.
- _createCompleteConceptsFile_: Always set to false, true provides an additional level of denormalization not implemented in any APIS today and increases significantly the size of the resulting model.
- _editionName_: name for this edition.
- _databaseName_: short name for the edition, used for the ongodb database.
- _effectiveTime_: release date/effective time for the finl package, if it combines the International Edition and an extension use the later date, usually the extension one.
- _expirationTime_: date when a warning needs to appear in the browser to announce that data may be deprecated.
- _outputFolder_: folder where the resulting .json files will be stored.
- _foldersBaselineLoad_: list of folders with baseline edition snapshots, usually the international edition.
- _modulesToIgnoreBaselineLoad_: list of Modules SCTIDs in the baseline files to ignore during conversion.
- _foldersExtensionLoad_: list of folders with extension edition files.
- _modulesToIgnoreExtensionLoad_: list of Modules SCTIDs in the extension files to ignore during conversion.

If the base edition and the extension are available in a single RF2 snapshot package, this folder can be used as a single baseline folder. All folders will be recursively expored and RF2 files will be indentified base on file names and headers (firs row of the file).

You can find sample config files in the `config` folder.

## Executing conversion
Run the executable jar file:

```
java -Xmx8g -jar rf2-to-json-conversion-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar config.xml
```

The results will be a set of .json files in the output folder.

## Importing data
The snapshot API requires a MongoDB database to store the denormalized representation contained in the .json files. MongoDb 2.6.x is required to leverage its latest adavances in full text search.

This project includes a script file for importing the resulting .json files into MongoDB, and creating the necessary indexes. This sentence needs to be executed from the folder that contains the .json files. The script will use the `mongoimport` command provided by mongoDB, it is expected to be in the path, as well as `mongo` runtime.

`./import.sh en-edition 20140731`

The first parameter is the edition short name, and the second is the effective time. The edition and effective time will be used to configure the Rest API that runs with this data.

## Easy Use instructions for IHTSDO Maven repository users:
Assumes the use of Ubuntu or a debian linux This build will build to jars and to a .deb file which will contain the jar and a variety of script files

## Steps:
1) Get the .deb onto the linux machine by either adding the the ihtsdo repository or  by building the .deb yourself using maven.

sudo echo "deb [https://maven.ihtsdotools.org/content/repositories/releases/](https://maven.ihtsdotools.org/content/repositories/releases/) ./" >   /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ihtsdo.releases.list sudo wget -O - [https://maven.ihtsdotools.org/service/local/repositories/releases/content/apt-key.gpg.key](https://maven.ihtsdotools.org/service/local/repositories/releases/content/apt-key.gpg.key) | apt-key add - sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install rf2-to-json-conversion

2) cd /opt/rf2-to-json-conversion

3) Get the relevant SNOMED international release using wget/curl or similar

4) If importing an extension, get that too.

5) cd to the conf folder and edit the relevant xml file ( e.g. if adding the swedish extension you will want to edit the seConfig.xml file)

6) Set the following values $EFF_TIME, $EXP_TIME, $PATH_TO_SNOMED_RELEASE  and (if an extension) $PATH_TO_EXTENSION_RELEASE

Time/date values are in the yyyymmdd format e.g. 20150331 The path should be a full path to the RF2 releases/Snapshot directory e.g. /home/test/releases/SnomedCT_RF2Release_INT_20150131/Snapshot

7) Save the changes and then cd to the parent dir (cd ..).

8) Edit run.sh setting $CONFIG to the name of the config xml file you have edited e.g seConfig.

9) run "./run.sh". This should create the json files. Note where the json is saved to.

10) When run has finished/while it is running edit zipAndUpload.sh set:

"json_dir" to the path where the json is being/has been written to. "desturl" to the machine you wish to copy the json to (where the mongodb is).

If need be set destuser and destdir if left if will use the current user & copy to the home folder of that user on the remote machine. Check you can ssh onto the destination machine prior to running zipAndUpload.sh as it use scp to copy the files.

11) Once the run.sh has finished then run zipAndUpload.sh e.g. "./zipAndUpload.sh"

12) ssh to desturl machine & get to the directory where you have scp'ed the files You should find 2 files: json.tgz and unzip-import.sh

13) Edit unzip-import.sh and set:

edition:  e.g. edition="en-edition"

importDate:  the import date same formate as expdate etc in (6) e.g. 20150531

14) Run unzip-import.sh e.g. "./unzip-import.sh"
